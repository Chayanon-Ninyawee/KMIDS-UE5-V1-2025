# Setting Up Visual Studio Code for Unreal Engine 5

Follow these steps to set up Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for Unreal Engine 5 based on the guide from Epic Games:

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code
Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## 2. Install Required Extensions
Open VS Code and install the following extensions:
- **C++**: Provides language support for C++.
- **CMake Tools**: Useful for working with CMake projects.
- **CodeLLDB**: Adds debugging capabilities.

To install extensions:
1. Click on the Extensions view (Ctrl+Shift+X).
2. Search for the extension names.
3. Click Install.

## 3. Generate VS Code Project Files
1. Open Unreal Editor and click **Tools** > **Generate Visual Studio Code Project**.

## 4. Configure the Project in VS Code
1. Open the project in VS Code by clicking **File > Open Folder** and selecting your Unreal project folder.
2. Wait for VS Code to index the project files.

## 5. Enable IntelliSense
Ensure your C++ configuration in VS Code is correct:
1. Open the **Command Palette** (Ctrl+Shift+P).
2. Search for and run **C/C++: Edit Configurations (UI)**.
3. Verify that the `compilerPath` points to your compiler (e.g., MSVC or Clang).
4. Add the include paths for Unreal Engine. These can be found in the `Engine/Source` and your projectâ€™s `Source` folders.

## 6. Additional Tips
- For better performance, exclude unnecessary folders from IntelliSense indexing. Add them to the `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
    "files.exclude": {
        "**/Intermediate/**": true,
        "**/Saved/**": true,
        "**/Binaries/**": true
    },
    "C_Cpp.default.configurationProvider": "vector-of-bool.cmake-tools"
}
```

- Regularly update your extensions for the latest features and fixes.

You are now ready to use VS Code with Unreal Engine 5!

# Known Issues

### Microsoft Azure DevOps Git LFS
There is currently a problem with Microsoft Azure DevOps Git LFS integration. This affects cloning the repository for users who are not explicitly added to the project.  
To avoid this issue, contributors must:
- Be added to the project by me.
- Ensure they have access to Git LFS through Azure DevOps.
